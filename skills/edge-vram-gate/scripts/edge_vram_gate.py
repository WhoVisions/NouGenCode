"""VRAM admission gate for Workspace (RTX 4050 Laptop, 6141 MiB).

Operator rule, 2026-08-08: "EVERY REQUEST SHOULD SEE IF VRAM IS CLEAR."
Context: spilled generation crashed the machine on 2026-08-08, and the IRIS
vision lane (TacticalNode-Ai/persistence/look.py) deliberately pins qwen3-vl:4b
resident at ~3.53 GB with keep_alive=-1 — so free VRAM, not total, is the
budget, and it is usually ~1.5-2.5 GB.

Call check_vram(model) before ANY local Ollama request. It answers with a
verdict instead of raising, so callers can route to the fleet or skip:

    from nougen_shards.vram_gate import check_vram
    v = check_vram("gemma4:e2b")
    if not v.ok:
        # route to fleet / skip / report v.reason — do NOT generate locally
